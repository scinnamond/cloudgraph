The goal of HGraph is to persist and retrieve any arbitrary 
Data Graph using the Hadoop NoSQL Database, HBase. The term 'HGraph' 
therefore stands for "Hadoop Graph".   
</p>
<p>
HGraph is based on the Service Data Objects (SDO) 2.1 specification 
and is designed as an SDO Data Access Service (DAS) under the 
PlasmaSDO™ Service Data Objects 2.1 implementation. 
</p>
<p>
Numerous best practices have evolved out of the 
HBase and Hadoop open-source software ecosystem. Several are
quite restrictive such as the support for ACID transactions
only across a single HBase row. Other critical best practices
involve the use of column families and in particular the format
and length of composite row and column keys, as these all can effect the 
general performance and especially the even distribution of 
data across regions in an HBase cluster. 
</p>
<p>
The HGraph implementation encapsulates many HBase best practices
in each of these areas and provides the user with an intuitive
convenient and standards-based API generated from a user-provided, 
domain-specific business model. Complexities of terse and efficient
physical row and column key generation are completely hidden 
and the client user is provided with a meaningful view of his/her
business entities and attributes. 
</p>
<p>
Typical CRUD operations are provided across any full or partial 
data graph, and any "slice" of a graph or set of
sub-graph slices can be returned using 
common SDO query mechanisms including XPath and others.
